<h2>What is <%=t('sufia.product_name') %>?</h2>
<p>
  ArchiveSphere builds on the technical infrastructure developed to implement ScholarSphere, and extends the ongoing digital preservation and access work being pursued by Special Collections. The focus of ArchiveSphere will be on developing web applications specific to preserving and providing access to Penn State's archival collections, and integrating services around finding aid and inventory display, search and browse across finding aids, curation services that preserve and represent file relationships and directory structures in addition to discreet files, functionality that supports records management requirements associated with University Archives, and curation and preservation support for both born-digital records and digitized analog surrogates.
